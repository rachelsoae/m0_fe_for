# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I feel pretty good about it! I had to play with it a bit, but once it finally clicked it was very exciting.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I had a bit of both. I had to take frequent breaks and, honestly, just let myself feel some frustration so that I could get over it and come back to it. Being hungry made it worse; I performed much better after dinner!

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I definitely want to memorize a few of these methods so that I don't have to keep referencing them. I realize I'll never memorize all of them, but I think it will help to have a few in my back pocket. I do need to make some time in the later evenings to preview and/or review my notes from the day. I'd like to make a list of things that still feel "sticky" or that I'm not comfortable with, to prioritize practicing. 
I also want to factor "practice" time into my schedule; not just for looking up answers to questions or studying my notes, but actually playing with code and doing more examples/practices until I'm positive I understand how things work.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
Why do these methods all format so differently?? Sometimes you put something in the parentheses, sometimes you don't, sometimes they go on their own line and sometimes they need to be included within the console.log(). The fact that they don't fit into the code the same way makes it harder.
I will need to study and look into what the methods are actually accomplishing; I'm positive that explains why they have to interact and be placed differently with the surrounding code.
